Error definitions for [Flora](https://github.com/florajs/flora).

This module exposes error classes for different types of errors to be able to determine whether an error should be displayed to the client (such as AuthenticationError) or not (internal errors).

To be able to pass through the error type to clients, a `code` property is also set. The default error codes are listed below.

## Error classes

### RequestError

- Generic request error (the user made an invalid request)
- HTTP status code `400`, the `message` will be displayed
- Error code is `ERR_REQUEST_ERROR`

### AuthenticationError

- The user is either not authenticated, or the credentials are wrong
- HTTP status code `401`
- Error code is `ERR_AUTHENTICATION_ERROR`

### AuthorizationError

- The user may be authenticated, but is not authorized for the requested action
- HTTP status code `403`
- Error code is `ERR_AUTHORIZATION_ERROR`

### NotFoundError

- Either the requested resource could not be found, or a specific entity of the resource.
- HTTP status code `404`, `message` will be displayed
- Error code is `ERR_NOT_FOUND`

### GoneError

- The requested resource is gone, e.g. was deleted
- HTTP status code `410`, `message` will be displayed
- Error code is `ERR_GONE`

### ImplementationError

- There is a problem with the implementation, e.g. of one of the resources. This should not happen
